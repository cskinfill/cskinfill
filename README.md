I am a software engineer that lately has been working in the intersection of software development and cloud infrastructure, especially with Kubernetes and the broader CNCF ecosystem.

## Projects
A few projects I'm playing around with
* [pgkube](https://github.com/cskinfill/pgkube) - Project to create a Kubernetes Operator in Rust using [kube.rs](https://kube.rs/).
* Implementing a simple REST/HTTP service that returns a list of `Service` resources, implemented in different languages
  * [golang](https://github.com/cskinfill/gohacking)
  * [Python](https://github.com/cskinfill/pythonhacking)
  * [Rust](https://github.com/cskinfill/rusthacking)
